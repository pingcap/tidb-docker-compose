# TiDB docker-compose

## Requirements

* Docker >= 16.10
* Docker Compose >= 1.6.0

## Quick start

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-docker-compose.git
$ cd tidb-docker-compose && docker-compose up -d
$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4000 -u root
```

* Access monitor at http://localhost:3000

Default user/password: admin/admin

* Access [tidb-vision](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-vision) at http://localhost:8010

* Access Spark Web UI at http://localhost:8080
  and access [TiSpark](https://github.com/pingcap/tispark) through spark://127.0.0.1:7077

## Customize TiDB Cluster

### Configuration

* config/pd.toml is copied from [PD repo](https://github.com/pingcap/pd/tree/master/conf)
* config/tikv.toml is copied from [TiKV repo](https://github.com/pingcap/tikv/tree/master/etc)
* config/tidb.toml is copied from [TiDB repo](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/tree/master/config)

If you find these configuration files outdated or mismatch with TiDB version, you can copy these files from their upstream repos and change their metrics addr with `pushgateway:9091`. Also `max-open-files` are configured to `1024` in tikv.toml to simplify quick start on Linux, because setting up ulimit on Linux with docker is quite tedious.

And config/*-dashboard.json are copied from [TiDB-Ansible repo](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-ansible/tree/master/scripts)

You can customize TiDB cluster configuration by editing docker-compose.yml and the above config files if you know what you're doing.

But edit these files manually is tedious and error-prone, a template engine is strongly recommended. See the following steps

### Install Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is used as a template render engine

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get | bash
```

Or if you use Mac, you can use homebrew to install Helm by `brew install kubernetes-helm`

### Bring up TiDB cluster

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-docker-compose.git
$ cd tidb-docker-compose
$ vi compose/values.yaml # custom cluster size, docker image, port mapping etc
$ helm template compose > generated-docker-compose.yaml
$ docker-compose -f generated-docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

You can build docker image yourself for development test.

* Build from binary

  For pd, tikv and tidb, comment their `image` and `buildPath` fields out. And then copy their binary files to pd/bin/pd-server, tikv/bin/tikv-server and tidb/bin/tidb-server.

  These binary files can be built locally or downloaded from https://download.pingcap.org/tidb-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz

  For tidbVision, comment its `image` and `buildPath` fields out. And then copy tidb-vision repo to tidb-vision/tidb-vision.

* Build from source

  Leave pd, tikv, tidb and tidbVision `image` field empty and set their `buildPath` field to their source directory.

  For example, if your local tikv source directory is $GOPATH/src/github.com/pingcap/tikv, just set tikv `buildPath` to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/pingcap/tikv`

  *Note:* Compiling tikv from source consumes lots of memory, memory of Docker for Mac needs to be adjusted to greater than 6GB

[tidb-vision](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-vision) is a visiualization page of TiDB Cluster, it's WIP project and can be disabled by commenting `tidbVision` out.

[TiSpark](https://github.com/pingcap/tispark) is a thin layer built for running Apache Spark on top of TiDB/TiKV to answer the complex OLAP queries.

### Debug TiDB/TiKV/PD instances
Prerequisites:

Pprof: This is a tool for visualization and analysis of profiling data. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/google/pprof#building-pprof) to install pprof.

Graphviz: [http://www.graphviz.org/](http://www.graphviz.org/), used to generate graphic visualizations of profiles.

* debug TiDB or PD instances

```bash
### Use the following command to starts a web server for graphic visualizations of golang program profiles
$ ./tool/container_debug -s pd0 -p /pd-server -w
```
The above command will produce graphic visualizations of profiles of `pd0` that can be accessed through the browser.

* debug TiKV instances

```bash
### step 1: select a tikv instance(here is tikv0) and specify the binary path in container to enter debug container
$ ./tool/container_debug -s tikv0 -p /tikv-server

### after step 1, we can generate flame graph for tikv0 in debug container
$ ./run_flamegraph.sh 1  # 1 is the tikv0's process id

### also can fetch tikv0's stack informations with GDB in debug container
$ gdb /tikv-server 1 -batch -ex "thread apply all bt" -ex "info threads"
```

### Access TiDB cluster

TiDB uses ports: 4000(mysql) and 10080(status) by default

```bash
$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4000 -u root
```

And Grafana uses port 3000 by default, so open your browser at http://localhost:3000 to view monitor dashboard

If you enabled tidb-vision, you can view it at http://localhost:8010
